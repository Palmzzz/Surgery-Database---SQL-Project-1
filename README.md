My eigth project was my first venture into using SQL and focused on practice writing SQL statements using aggregate functions and subqueries,
As well as building a small database to hold details of doctors’ surgeries’ patients.

The SQL file incldudes the answers for the SQL queries I submitted for the following:

1, Display the names of those patients who do not live in Lichfield.
2. Display the total number of surgeries.
3. Return the total budget for Lichfield.
4. Display the average budget allocation for patients attending surgery 231.
5. Produce a query to show by how much the budget of patients with an above average budget differs from the average.
6. Select the total cost of the budget for surgeries 231 and 243 only.
7. Return the names of any patients with a budget greater than the average for surgery 243.
8. Return the names of any patients with a budget allocation greater than any of the patients attending surgery 231.
9. Return the patients with an above average budget allocation. Patients should be in alphabetical order.
10. Return the names of patients without a House No in alphabetical order.
